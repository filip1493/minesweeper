# minesweeper
- Implemented a complete Minesweeper game using Java Swing, including grid-based GUI, mouse input handling (left/right click), and real-time game state updates.
- Designed the game engine for mine placement, neighbor mine counting, recursive field opening, win/lose detection, and flag management.
- Built a custom button component and integrated icon-based rendering for opened cells, mines, flags, and incorrect flags.
